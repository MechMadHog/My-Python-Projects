# Dictionaries are to Python.
#What JSON objects are to JavaScript.

#In Python code-blocks are never wrapped in "{...}".
#In Python "{...}" are used to Define Dictionaries.

#This is the simplist format to parse data.

print({"name": "Michael", "age": "29", "skill": "code"})
#Creating the Values for this Dictionary.
print({"name": "Michael", "age": "29", "skill": "code"}['name'])
#Dictionaries are not Lists, so using a number will not work.
#The name of the  value must be used.
